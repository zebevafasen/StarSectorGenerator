Another Idea I had was to actually integrate the current "Cluster" generation we already have (although it would have to be tweaked a little bit). The ideas was to either:

a) Make Clusters more "important" by giving each Cluster it's own Core System (which would probably not all be these "Super Systems", still only one of those per Sector, I think).
b) Make the Sector's Core System be the anchor from which these Clusters generate.

What do you think?
