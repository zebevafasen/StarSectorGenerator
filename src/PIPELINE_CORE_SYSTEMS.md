# Pipeline: Core Systems Overhaul

This document outlines the architectural plan for implementing **Core Systems** as the primary anchors of sector development.

## 1. Phase One: The Macro-Placement (Sector [Q, R] Logic) - COMPLETED
*   Implemented `calculateIdealCoreHex` which deterministically places the "Landing Site" based on galactic drift.

## 2. Phase Two: Clustering Overhaul (The Anchor) - COMPLETED
*   Forced Core Hex as the primary anchor for system clusters.
*   Implemented strict 20% system density for Clustered mode to ensure distinct voids.
*   Guaranteed system presence at the Core Hex.

## 3. Phase Three: System-Level "Bending" (The Super-System) - COMPLETED
*   Implemented 1.5x Star Age boost for Core systems.
*   Guaranteed "Super-Earth" (Breathable/Temperate Terrestrial) at the primary slot.
*   Implemented 8x Population Multiplier for all inhabited worlds in Core systems.

## 4. Phase Four: UI & Visual Identity - COMPLETED
*   Added rotating golden dashed ring to Core systems on the map.
*   Added Gold "CORE SYSTEM" crown badge to the Selection Header.
*   Renamed "Systems" to "Objects" in the header to include POIs.
